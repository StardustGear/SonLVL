# SonLVL
(experimental branch)  
Supports 16-bit object IDs and SubTypes, though may be buggy sometimes.  
Mainly targeted at users that have custom engines for SonLVL that utilize 16-bit IDs and subtypes.  
Object definitions for older games don't compile properly since they rely on 8-bit subtypes.
